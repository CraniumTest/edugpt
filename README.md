# README for EduGPT - Personalized Learning Assistant

## Overview

EduGPT is a Python-based application designed to deliver a personalized learning experience by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Using OpenAI's GPT-3 model, EduGPT generates tailored learning plans and interactive content based on individual student profiles. This tool aims to enhance educational outcomes by adjusting to each student's preferred learning styles and academic progress.

## Key Features

1. **Personalized Content Generation:**
   - Utilizes student data to create customized learning plans.
   - Adapts content to suit learning styles such as visual, auditory, and kinesthetic.

2. **Technology Integration:**
   - Implements OpenAI's API to invoke powerful language model outputs.
   - Processes learning data and student attributes using `pandas` and `numpy`.

3. **Simple Execution:**
   - Iterates over a predefined set of students to generate and print personalized learning paths.

4. **Scalability and Flexibility:**
   - Can be extended to incorporate more robust data sets and student metrics.
   - The underlying structure supports further development into complex educational platforms.

5. **Expandable Backend:**
   - Provides a foundation which can be expanded into a web application using `flask` to allow for dynamic, real-time interactions.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**: Ensure you have a compatible Python version.
- **External Libraries**:
  - `openai` for interacting with the GPT-3 API.
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and handling.
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.
  - `flask` as an optional backend server framework.

## Installation

1. Clone the project repository or create the necessary files as outlined in the shell script provided in the setup documentation.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd EduGPT
   ```

3. Install the required packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Ensure your OpenAI API key is correctly set in `edugpt.py`. Replace `'your-api-key-here'` with your actual API key.

To run the module and generate personalized learning plans, execute:

```bash
python edugpt.py
```

The script will iterate through the sample student data and print out customized learning content for each profile.

## Further Development

EduGPT serves as a prototype to demonstrate the personalization of educational content using AI. Future development could include:
- Extensive dataset integration from educational platforms.
- Interactive front-end for student and educator engagement.
- Advanced progress analysis and recommendation algorithms.

By leveraging AI in educational contexts, EduGPT aims to personalize and potentially revolutionize learning experiences by addressing the unique educational needs of each student.
